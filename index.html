      <ol class="faq-list">
        <li>
          <h4>Do I pay for the services?</h4>
          <p>Yes. Our clients are the job seekers and our main focus is their
          goals and needs. You are paying for the job training services, so we
          can make sure your interests are coming first and your expectations
          are met.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>We are providing job search training, helping you be more
          prepared, and increasing your hiring potential.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Is there a difference between job search in Canada comparing to the job search processes in other countries?</h4>
          <p>Different countries have different cultures, job search processes, application requirements and interview structure. In order to increase your chances to successfully finding a job in Canada, your resume, cover letter and interview preparation has to meet the local requirements and employers’ expectations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>How Career Mind services are different from those provided by other organizations?</h4>
          <p>We are providing job search training and services regardless of your English level or score, your status of immigration (visitor visa, work visa, student visa, permanent resident) or your age.
We also provide services to those who are planning to move to Canada and haven’t received their status yet, or still in their home country but yet would like to learn more about the Canadian job market and start looking for a job before landing in Canada.
Our services are tailored to the clients’ needs and provided in timely manner according to the client's schedule and urgency.</p>
